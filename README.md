# DataFest 2025 - Real Estate Analysis
At the 2025 ASA DataFest at UCLA, I worked alongside my teammates to analyze a proprietary dataset provided by Savills, a global commercial real estate firm. Over the span of 42 hours, we explored national trends in commercial lease data, focusing on the movement of businesses from central business districts to suburban locations over the past seven years. Our team engineered key features and built a logistic regression model that predicted lease location type (suburban or central business district) with 90% accuracy. We tailored our analysis to deliver actionable insights that could inform Savills’ client advisory strategies based on market conditions, industry type, and building attributes. Our work was recognized with the Judges’ Choice award, which honors teams whose approach demonstrated standout analytical rigor, creativity, and interpretability.
